## Online News Popularity Prediction 

The Internet is an important tool for sharing messages. 
A recent survey has shown that teenagers and adults read online news in their daily life.
This percentage has increased a lot in the past few years.
For reasons that more and more people read online news and editors want their news to be popular it would be meaningful to build a system to predict whether a news will be popular or not.
Such system can  help editors find how they could improve their news but also can bring significant commercial value. Thus we chose the “online news popularity” data set for capstone project.
