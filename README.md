## Online News Popularity Prediction 

The Internet is an important tool for sharing messages. 
A recent survey has shown that teenagers and adults read online news in their daily life.
This percentage has increased a lot in the past few years.
For reasons that more and more people read online news and editors want their news to be popular it would be meaningful to build a system to predict whether a news will be popular or not.
Such system can  help editors find how they could improve their news but also can bring significant commercial value. Thus we chose the “online news popularity” data set for capstone project.

## Problem Statement
Due to the increase in competition among the online news portals, Mashable has been facing a decrease in the number of shares of  its articles on social media which in turn has affected the advertisements featuring on its page.

## Objective of this Project
- To predict the popularity of news articles published by Mashable.com
- To find which data channel gains more popularity.
- To find which day the articles are more popular.

## Dataset Description 
The dataset summarizes heterogeneous set of features about the articles published by Mashable between 2013 and 2015.
- Number of Records : 39,643
- Number of features : 60
- Target column : 1

## Insights obtained from the DataSet
1. Keywords tends to attract many people towards reading the article. As the number of keywords in an article increases the shares as well increases.
2. People tend to share the articles which are having decent amount of words in the title. People don’t appreciate short titles.
3. Number of images as means of visualization plays a huge role in determining the shares an article since people don't have the      patience and time to watch a video and then share it to others.
4. People are tending to read articles under the world category since they have a perception they can read and know everything that is happening in the world.
5. People tend to read a lot of articles on Tuesday and Wednesday because as the weekend approaches, they wish to do some leisure activities and relax may be like watching a movie.
6. We can see that if the keywords in an article is good, we are getting high amount of shares also if the keywords are average in an article, we are getting average amount of shares and with worst keywords we are getting very less amount of shares.
